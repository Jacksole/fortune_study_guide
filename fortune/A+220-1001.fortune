UTP (unshielded twisted pair) Popular type of cabling for telephone and
networks, composed of pairs of wires twisted around each other at specific
intervals. The twists serve to reduce interference (also called crosstalk). The
more twists, the less interference. Unlike its cousin, STP, UTP cable has no
metallic shielding to protect the wires from external interference. 1000BaseT

for individual wire pairs reduces crosstalk and noise problems. Cat 7 is not an
ANSI/TIA standard.
